      <h1>Pausa</h1>
      <img src="./img/pausaappmain.png" alt="whatsapp encuestas"/>
      <p><span class="bold">Pausa</span> was born as an 8 day personal Wellness project during UX/UI Bootcamp at Ironhack. This was my first <span class="italics">solo project</span> where I spent 4 days on UX and 4 days on UI.</p>
      <h2 class="section">Brief</h2>
      <p>
        Health and wellbeing apps are these days an essential part of our lives. We use them to register healthy habits, connect with friends, etc. And the number of users is only growing, according to an <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-new-2018-consumer-survey-digital-health?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosvitals&stream=top-stories" target="_blank" >Accenture study</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Founded in 1977, National Wellness Institute is an institution in the field of health and wellbeing with many years of experience. They have been lagging behind in their digitalization, which have caused a significant lost of paying users. Their goal is to improve technologically to provide better services to their clients.</p>
      <p>The only requirements they have are:</p>
      <ul class="bulletpoints">
        <li>The app must focus on any area related with personal wellbeing.</li>
        <li>It should monitor user's progress and help them keep a healthier lifestyle.</li>
        <li>The UI should provide an improved and refreshed image.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="section">The problem</h2>
      <span class="quote">Stress mishandling at work.</span>
      <p>
        There are more than 12.500.000 Spaniards frequently suffering from stress at work. Half of European workers perceive stress as the norm in their workplace.
      </p>
      <p>
          With this project we'll identify the root causes of that stress mishandling, with the goal of helping our users keep healthier habits at work.
      </p>
      <h2 class="section">The solution</h2>
      <p>The solution is <span class="bold">Pausa</span>, an app that helps you schedule 1 to 10 minute breaks – pausas in Spanish– using different methods to reduce stress and increase productivity.</p>
      <img src="./img/pausa hero.png" alt="pausa app"/>
      <h4>Empathize</h4>
      <h2>Surveys and interviews</h2>
      <p>I interviewed 5 people and made a survey filled by 65 people in order to learn more about my potential users. Questions focused on understanding what factors generate stress at work and what method people use to handle that stress.</p>
      <p>Keys from the surveys and interviews:</p>
      <ul class="bulletpoints">
          <li>60% Forget to take a break during working hours</li>
          <li>The average break length is from 1 to 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>The most <span class="bold">common consequences</span> are: <span class="bold">muscular stress</span>, <span class="bold">bad mood</span>, <span class="bold">anxiety</span>, <span class="bold">headache</span>, <span class="bold">tiredness</span>, <span class="bold">itchy eyes</span> and<span class="bold"> insomnia</span>.</li>
          <li>Users have <span class="bold">different stress handling methods</span>: meditation, listening to music, chat with a colleague, have a coffee, take a walk, do yoga, sleep, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <span class="quote">"I spent the whole day sitting and sometimes I don't even remember to take a break." — Marta</span>
      <p>According to some studies, taking short breaks during the day can decrease stress and improve productivity. However, we can see from the surveys and interviews data how a significant percentage of people forget to take a break.</p>
      <h2 class="section">Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>The main takeaways from analyzing stress handling at work apps are:</p>
      <ul class="bulletpoints">
          <li>There are plenty of yoga, meditation and time tracking apps in the market.</li>
          <li>Most of those apps provide a single method to handle stress.</li>
          <li>Yoga apps don't take into account workplace limitations. They also don't allow filtering by type of pain or muscular stress</li>
      </ul>
      <br></br>
      <p>Our main differentiator is offering <span class="bold">small, scheduled, and personalized break sessions, from 1 to 10 minutes</span> in the same app.</p>
      <h4>Define</h4>
      <h2>User Persona</h2>
      <p>At this stage of the process, I gathered all the information from the surveys, interviews, studies and competitive analysis, creating an Affinity Diagram. Here, I placed all the key ideas that helped me identify interesting opportunities for the app.</p>
      <p>I then created my user persona, Marta, highlighting her goals and problems so I could better understand her needs.</p>
      <img src="./img/marta user persona.png" alt="marta user persona" />
      <p>I used a <span class="italics">StoryBoard</span> and <span class="italics">User Journey</span> to emphasize with Marta's day to day at work.</p>
      <img src="./img/story board pausa.jpeg" alt="storyboard" />
      <p>[1] Marta arrives at work at 9am. [2] At 12pm she has a meeting with her boss. She assigns her more work. [3] At 2pm she takes a break to have lunch and she feels tired. [4]She keeps working nonstop until 6pm but she doesn't finish all the tasks. [5] Her back and head aches on the way home, [6] She finallhy goes to bed. But she finds it difficult to sleep. </p>
      <img src="./img/user journey pausa.png" alt="user journey" />
      <p>We can detect <span class="bold">3 points </span>with these tools:</p>
      <ol class="numberlist">
          <li>Marta arrives at work tired because she couldn't rest properly due to stress.</li>
          <li>She doesn't know how to communicate her boss she's tired.</li>
          <li>She forgets to take breaks during work hours and ends up with a headache and shoulder pain.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Ideate</h4>
      <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
      <p>I then started devising possible app features.</p>
      <p><span class="bold"> HMW</span>: How might we help Marta find time to rest and decrease stress level during working hours?</p>
      <p>I organized ideas in a <span class="bold">MOSCOW</span> after a Brainstorming round. This way of organizing ideas helped me decide what features were essential for the first product version.</p>
      <ul class="bulletpoints">
          <li>Register dashboard.</li>
          <li>Break scheduler.</li>
          <li>Short meditation by mood.</li>
          <li>Relaxing music.</li>
          <li>Naps.</li>
          <li>Short yoga classes by body parts, either on the floor or on a chair</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="section">Card Sorting & Site Map</h2>
      <p>Keeping in mind the MVP I did a <span class="italics">card sorting</span> with 5 people, which helped me design the app's sitemap.</p>
      <img src="./img/site map pausa.png" alt="site map" />
      <p>I designed the <span class="italics">user flow</span> for a new and a registered user, to have a clear vew of the interactions the prototype needed to have.</p>
      <img src="./img/user flow pausa.jpeg" alt="user flow" />
      <h4>Prototype and Iterate</h4>
      <h2>Low Fidelity</h2>
      <p>With the information organized and the tasks added to the <span class="italics">user flow</span>, I started working on the first low-fi paper version of the app. This way we can save costs and time, been able to iterate fast with the <span class="italics">feedback</span> received during the <span class="italics">Usability tests</span> .</p>
      <img src="./img/low fi pausa.jpeg" alt="low fidelity" />
      <p>The following were the main points to add to our <span class="italics">mid-fidelity</span> after doing the first usability test to 5 people:</p>
      <ul class="bulletpoints">
          <li>Users can't save scheduled breaks because buttons are not consistent during the scheduling task flow.</li>
          <li>The repeating days popup is not clearly understood.</li>
          <li>Users look for a way to distinguish pending from finished breaks.</li>
          <li>The add scheduled break feature from the main menu was not completely understood.</li>
          <li>The information shown at the scheduling break screens is confusing and disorganized</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="section">Mid Fedility</h2>
      <p>With all the learnings from the low-fidelity I started iterating over the mid-fidelity on Sketch.</p>
      <img src="./img/mid fidelity pausa.png" alt="mid fidelity" />
      <p>Once prototyped in sketch, I used inVision to do a second testing round with 5 more users.</p>
      <p>The main takeaways were:</p>
      <ul class="bulletpoints">
          <li>Users couldn't finish the first task because the confirm icon wasn't clear enough.</li>
          <li>Add a signifier to the calendar so it shows it can be opened.</li>
          <li>Suggest breaks when a new user finishes registering.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="section">High Fidelity</h2>
      <p>I started developing the high fidelity with the changes discovered during the mid fidelity usability test. Once again, I did another usability test to 5 users. The main learnings were:</p>
      <ul class="bulletpoints">
          <li>80% of the users find hard saving a scheduled break.</li>
          <li>There were some text issues.</li>
          <li>Users couldn't choose the type of break when choosing the take a break now feature.</li>
          <li>Slider numbers are small and users can't properly see them when using the finger.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With all this feedback I iterated into a new high fidelity version.</p>
      <img src="./img/high fidelity pausa.png" alt="high fidelity" />
      <h4>Branding</h4>
      <h2>Moodboard</h2>
      <p>I started the branding with a <span class="bold">Moodboard</span>. I looked for different pictures which represented my brand's attributes. Those were <span class="bold">welcoming</span> and <span class="bold">tranquillizing</span>.</p>
      <img src="./img/moodboard pausa.png" alt="moodboard" />
      <p>I made a <span class="italics">Desirability Test</span> with 5 users and could confirm the style tile represents the brand's attributes. The most common adjectives used to described the moodboard were warmth, calm, positive energy and tranquility.</p>
      <img src="./img/desirability test pausa.png" alt="desirability test" />
      <h2>Style guide</h2>
      <p>Once settled on the branding, I started working on the high fidelity and designing the style guide in parallel. This way I made sure the style was consistent and that it was aligned with the brand's voice and mission. The style guide includes the following guidelines and reference guides:</p>
      <p><span class="bold">Typography</span> : The chosen typography is Open Sans, a <span class="italics">sans serif</span> with open forms and neutral appearance with very good legibility.
      </p>
      <img src="./img/typography pausa.png" alt="typography" />
      <p> <span class="bold">Colors</span>: The brand is represented with 3 main colors –<span class="italics">Fountain Blue, Rajah y Comet</span>. Using the blue-ish color as primary, representing water and calm. The orange one is used as accent color, representing warmth.</p>
      <img src="./img/colores pausa.png" alt="typography" />
      <img src="./img/componentes pausa.png" alt="componentes" />
      <img src="./img/iconografia pausa.png" alt="iconografia" />
      <img src="./img/ui elements pausa.png" alt="ui elements" />
      <img src="./img/grids pausa.png" alt="grids y layouts" />
      <h2>Animating with Flinto</h2>
      <p>I then animated a prototype using Flinto. In this first video we can see how a user gets registered and schedule a break to meditate.</p>
      <img class="gif" src="./img/pausa flinto.gif" alt="pausa flinto">
      <p>In this second video we can see how a user starts a pause straight away, without scheduling.</p>
      <img class="gif" src="./img/pausa flinto 2.gif" alt="pausa flinto">
      <h2>Landing</h2>
      <p>Once the prototype was done, I developed the product's <span class="italics">landing page</span>, where users can download the app, read the features and comments from other users. </p>
      <img class="landing" src="./img/landing pausa.gif" alt="pausa landing">
      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>Some features I'd like to try out are:</p>
      <ul class="bulletpoints">
          <li>Add work calendar sync to automatically recommend breaks.</li>
          <li>Invite coworkers to take a break with you.</li>
          <li>Sync Pausa notifications with smart watches</li>
          <li>Save favorites.</li>
      </ul>
