      <h1>Portfolio</h1>
      <img src="./img/portfolio.png" alt="portfolio"/>
      <p>I started by designing a personal brand in order to create a style that represented myself and were consistent with my personality.
      </p>
      <h2 class="section">Brand Personality</h2>
      <p>The first exercise I did to design my portfolio was <span class="bold">Jennifer Aaker's</span> <span class="italics">The five dimensions of brand personality</span>. The goal is to pick 2 adjectives that represent your brand and 1 that doesn't. In my case:</p>
      <span class="quote">I'm <span class="bold">charming</span> and <span class="bold">organized</span> but no <span class="bold">rigid</span>.</span>
      <h2 class="section">Brand Affinity</h2>
      <p>The second exercise I did was a <span class="italics">brand affinity</span>. With this exercise we can define our brand personality by referencing people, things and even other brands that we think have a similar personality. So, if I was a famous character I'd be <span class="italics">Mónica Geller</span>, if I was an animal I'd be a <span class="italics">bengal cat</span>, and if I was another brand I'd be <span class="italics">Muji</span>.</p>
      <img src="./img/brand personality.png" alt="brand personality"/>
      <h2 class="section">Moodboard</h2>
      <p>Once my brand personality and affinity were defined, I created a <span class="italics">moodboard</span> with images where those ideas were represented.</p>
      <img src="./img/moodboard portfolio.png" alt="moodboard"/>
      <p>Then, I did a <span class="italics">desirability test</span> with my colleagues at IronHack in order to confirm my moodboard and my brand attributed were consistent. Some of the adjectives they used to describe the moodboard were: <span class="bold">organized, ordered, nordic, cozy, hygge and relaxed.</span></p>
      <h2 class="section">Style tile</h2>
      <p>I got my brand's color palette from the moodboard's images, and with that I created the <span class="italics">style tile</span>. I chose <span class="italics">Open Sans</span> as typography, a <span class="italics">Sans serif</span> with open and neutral forms, with a friendly appearance and great legibility.</p>
      <img src="./img/style tile.png" alt="style tile"/>
      <h2 class="section">Error Screens</h2>
      <p>I designed two error screens in Sketch to get inspired for the mood I wanted my portfolio to portray.</p>
      <img class="smaller" src="./img/pantallas de erro.png" alt="pantallas de error"/>
      <h2 class="section">Logo</h2>
      <p>For the logo, I used Adobe Illustrator to trace a personal image and create my logo from it. Here you can see how I traced the image's contour and then filled it with color.</p>
      <img class="smaller" src="./img/logo laura.png" alt="logo"/>
      <h2>Portfolio Design</h2>
      <p>The last step, before starting to code, was designing the layout using Sketch. I exported the design to Zeplin once it was finished, so it was easier to work on the coding side.</p>
      <img src="./img/wirefram portfolio.png" alt="wireframe"/>
      <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
      <p>We learned the basics of HTML and CSS during the 7th week of the UX/UI Bottcamp at Ironhack. In that week we coded our own personal portfolios using tools like Zeplin, iTerm, Visual Studio Code and Github. The week was a busy one, but we learned a ton of things. It was also very satisfying seeing the final result. Here's the <a class="color-touch" href="https://github.com/Laurosa/cv_portfolio" target="_blank"> Github's project</a>.</p>
